CIFAR-10 dataset can be found here: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

Convolutional Neural Networks:
The images in CIFAR-10 have 3 color channels: red,green,blue. So, an image is represented as a matrix of dimensions width*height*number_of_chanels. Images are of much larger size so we use Convolutional Neural Networks. They are capable of learning much better than simple Feed forward NNs and perform better classification.
